      <description>I am passionate about building business applications with special focus on cloud-native technologies, Microsoft Azure in particular.
Started programming in my early years in college when I stumbled upon a coding book, the title was The C Programming Language .. I was hooked.
I had always wanted to create Art, but never found a venue that worked for me, and then, I felt like coding was that, I found that I could be creative and analytical all at the same time â€¦ Ah, that is all I wanted to do.</description>
